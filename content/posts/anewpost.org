#+begin_quote
Block quotes are
 written like so.

 They can span multiple paragraphs,
 if you like.
#+end_quote
Some text, and some =code= and then a nice plain [[https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/davidhampgonsalves.com-hugo][link with title]].

and then

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
+ Very easy!

vs.

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

** Code

Inline `code`

#+begin_src js 
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
#+end_src
